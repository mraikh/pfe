# PFE Project

## Refactoring Overview

I made some changes on the relationships and database structure. There was some issues and missuses with the structure of the relations between models. Also, I will implement the quiz logic to show you how it can be done.

This branch `refactor` will contain my version and implementations. I won't push it to the `main`, so there won't be any conflicts. Plus, I will not distribute your flow and process

***Note:***
The logic and routes will be just api's, I will not use view or blade!
The quiz implementation demo will be the only case with frontend, with AlpineJS. Just to demonstrate how you would implement the logic with JSON.
